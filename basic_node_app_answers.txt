1) What is a Node module?

    - A Node module is a collection of functions that will be used in the
      application.

2) What is the main difference between `exports` and `module.exports`?

    - `module.exports` is an object that is returned by require() and `exports` 
       is just a reference to the `module.exports` object.

3) Why is using exports recommended?

    -  Becasue `exports` is a reference, it cannot reassign the `module.exports`
       object.  Using `module.exports` will restrict the module to one object type.  
       Using `exports` will allow you to use various object types.
